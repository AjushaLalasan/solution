# Multi-Time Zone Clock Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a React app with multi-time zone clock functionality using both class and functional components.

## Components Created

### 1. ClassClock.js
- **Class Component** using `componentDidMount()` and `componentWillUnmount()`
- Timer updates every second using `setInterval`
- Proper cleanup in `componentWillUnmount()`
- State management for current time and cities
- Default cities: New York (-5), London (0), Tokyo (+9)
- Dynamic city addition with UTC offset input

### 2. FunctionalClock.js
- **Functional Component** using `useEffect()` hook
- Timer with cleanup function in `useEffect`
- Same functionality as class component but with hooks
- State management using `useState`
- Same default cities and dynamic addition feature

### 3. Updated App.js
- Added new "Multi-Time Zone Clock" tab as default
- Integrated both clock components side by side
- Maintained existing student admission and feedback functionality

## Features Implemented

### Core Requirements ✓
- ✅ Class component with `componentDidMount()` and `componentWillUnmount()`
- ✅ Functional component with `useEffect()` and cleanup
- ✅ Timer updates every second
- ✅ Three default cities (New York, London, Tokyo)
- ✅ UTC offset calculations using Date methods
- ✅ Time display format: HH:MM:SS

### Bonus Features ✓
- ✅ Dynamic city addition with name and UTC offset inputs
- ✅ Input validation (prevents empty city names)
- ✅ Responsive design with CSS styling
- ✅ Clean UI with hover effects and animations

### Output Format
```
New York: 08:15:22
London:   13:15:22
Tokyo:    22:15:22
```

## Styling
- Comprehensive CSS with responsive design
- Consistent styling with existing app theme
- Hover effects and smooth transitions
- Mobile-friendly layout

## Testing
- Created test files for both components
- Tests cover timer functionality, city addition, and cleanup
- Updated main App.test.js to include clock component tests
- All components pass syntax validation

## Usage
1. Navigate to "Multi-Time Zone Clock" tab (default)
2. View real-time updates for all cities
3. Add new cities using the input fields
4. Enter city name and UTC offset (e.g., "Paris" with offset "1")
5. Click "Add City" to include new time zones

The implementation successfully meets all requirements and includes comprehensive styling and testing.
